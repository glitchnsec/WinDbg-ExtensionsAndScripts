  ### Design Decisions

  ### Notes
  - Not exactly the first day I've worked on this but the first day I have started with a plan
  - Essentially, it's been a while I did anything with C++. So I have decided to read and completely
    understand the HelloWorld sample Microsoft provided before proceeding any further.
  - To do confirm my understand, I will, comment the entire HelloWorld code and once I'm done, return
    to coding this project.
  - See the Section "Hello World Notes" in the daily diaries

  ### Hello World Notes
  - The first step is building the Hello World Notes and confirming the code works as advertised
  - Commented all the non-standard code in SimpleIntroExtension.cpp
  - Unable to compile sample due to `'ExtratString':  is not a member of 'Debugger:DataModel::ClientEx::Details'`
  - Commented on [Github](https://github.com/microsoft/WinDbg-Samples/issues/15) and awaiting a response
